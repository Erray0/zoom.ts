= zoom.ts

A lightweight TypeScript library for image and video zooming, as seen on
https://medium.design/image-zoom-on-medium-24d146fc0c20[Medium].

`zoom.ts` easily plugs into your application with minimal overhead by including
no third-party dependencies and requiring less than 11kB of bandwidth when
minified. Once marked as zoomable, clicking an image or video will smoothly
expand it to fit the browser's entire viewport. The zoomed element will then
await dismissal from the user, either by clicking or scrolling away.

== Demo

A running demonstration can be found https://mikebull94.github.io/zoom.ts[here].

Holding either the +++<kbd>⌘</kbd>+++ or +++<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+++ key whilst
clicking the element will open the image in a new tab.

Zoomed elements can be dismissed either by clicking the element, scrolling away,
or pressing +++<kbd>Esc</kbd>+++.

== Installation

Install the library by either importing the
https://github.com/MikeBull94/zoom.ts/blob/master/src/script/ZoomListener.ts[`ZoomListener`]
TypeScript module and calling `new ZoomListener().listen()`, or
linking/requiring the
https://github.com/MikeBull94/zoom.ts/blob/master/dist/zoom.js[distribution
file].

Install the stylesheet by either importing
https://github.com/MikeBull94/zoom.ts/blob/master/src/style/index.scss[`index.scss`]
file or including/linking the
https://github.com/MikeBull94/zoom.ts/blob/master/dist/zoom.css[distribution
stylesheet].

Minified and optimized versions of both the
https://github.com/MikeBull94/zoom.ts/blob/master/dist/zoom.min.js[library] and
https://github.com/MikeBull94/zoom.ts/blob/master/dist/zoom.min.css[stylesheet]
are also available.

== Usage

Add the `data-zoom="zoom-in"` attribute to an `<img>` or `<video>` to have it
zoom in when clicked by a user.

The loading of a large resource can be deferred by specifying a `data-zoom-src`
attribute, where the value assigned contains the resource to load once the user
expands the element. The resource specified in the attribute is also the
resource that will be loaded if the user opens the image by clicking with either
+++<kbd>⌘</kbd>+++ or +++<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+++ held.

== Example

In the example snippet below an image of a forest will be displayed. Once the
user clicks to zoom in the image their browser will request the larger
`forest-full.jpg` file and replace the original `<img>` with the full-resolution
version.
