= zoom.ts

`zoom.ts` is a lightweight library for image and video zooming, as seen on
https://medium.design/image-zoom-on-medium-24d146fc0c20[Medium].

Written in https://www.typescriptlang.org[TypeScript] with no dependencies,
`zoom.ts` plugs into your website or application with ease with minimal
overhead, providing smooth transitions and dismissals of both image and video
elements. You can either use the ECMAScript 5 transpiled distribution files in
`/dist` or import the library in an existing TypeScript project.

== Usage

A running demonstration can be found https://mikebull94.github.io/zoom.ts[here].

Holding either the +++<kbd>⌘</kbd>+++ or +++<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+++ key whilst
clicking the element will open the image in a new tab.

Zoomed elements can be dismissed either by clicking the element, scrolling away,
or pressing +++<kbd>Esc</kbd>+++.

== Installation

Link the `zoom.min.js` and `zoom.min.css` files to your site or application,
then proceed to add `data-zoom="zoom-in"` to your `<img>` or `<video>` tags to
have them zoom in.

The loading of a large resource can be deferred by specifying a `data-zoom-src`
attribute, where the value assigned contains the resource to load once the
user expands the element. The resource specified in the attribute is also the
resource that will be loaded if the user opens the image by clicking with either
+++<kbd>⌘</kbd>+++ or +++<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+++ held.

In the example snippet below an image of a forest will be displayed. Once the
user clicks to zoom in the image their browser will request the larger
`forest-full.jpg` file and replace the original `<img>` with the full-resolution
version.

== Building

https://nodejs.org[node.js] is used to build the distribution.

The following commands can be ran in the project:

* `npm run build`
-- Lint, compile, minify, and optimize the stylesheets and scripts.
* `npm run watch`
-- Watch the file-system for changes, triggering rebuild of the stylesheets or
scripts if a change to the source of either is detected.
* `npm run clean`
-- Removes the output files under the `./dist` directory.
